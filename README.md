# Description:
>
 Functionality:
 The platform functions as “political matching” site. It matches citizens to candidates, based on profile input of the user. There are two types of users candidates and citizens. The user will make a profile and give their position on a number of political issues. Candidates have the ability to list themselves as candidates and can add information to their profile describing the office they are campaigning for. The platform allows users to see what candidates match their beliefs and allow candidates to see what voters they align with. The user is able to look at the other users pages and see their stances on issues.

# Usage:

    The PolitiCandid app is useful for anyone that is unsure if a particular candidate matches the same issues that the voter has. Allowing the voter to make informed decisions about their vote. 

# Setup 

  > When you first signup in order to see the matches with candidates or other users, the current user should create issues, their stance based on -10 to 10 point system, and mark if the issue is important or not. This will help the user/voter see like-minded candidates prior to the election voting day.
